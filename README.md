**Duration:** AUGUST to SEPTEMBER 2024
**Mentor:** NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

 **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
 **Project :** FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN
 **Objective:**
 Design and implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) that can model and control a specific system or process, such as:

- A vending machine
- A traffic light controller
- A digital clock
- A robotic arm

**Key Activities:**

1. Requirements gathering: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.
2. System analysis: Study the system or process to be modeled by the FSM.
3. State identification: Identify and define the states of the system or process.
4. Transition definition: Define the transitions between states.
5. State transition diagram/table creation: Create a visual representation of the FSM.
6. FSM implementation: Write code or design hardware to implement the FSM.
7. Simulation/testing: Verify and validate the FSM through simulation or testing.
8. Debugging: Identify and fix errors or issues in the FSM.
9. Optimization: Refine the FSM for efficiency, scalability, and reliability.
10. Documentation: Write a report detailing the FSM design and implementation.
11. Testing and validation: Develop test cases and report results.
12. Review and revision: Review the FSM design and implementation, and make revisions as needed.
